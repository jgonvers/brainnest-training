## Documentation for the Weather App

### main.py

```
import logging

from GUI_Weather import WeatherApp
```

Imports the python's lib for logging, and also _WeatherApp_ class from module GUI_Weather.

```
def main():
    try:
        app = WeatherApp()
        app.start()
```

Main function, `main()`, it tries to create an instance of the `WeatherApp` class and calls its methos `start()` which initiates the App.

```
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(e)
```

This code catches all the exceptions and logs them. It is used to prevent the application from crashing.

```
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
This code calls the main function only if this script is the main one.


### GUI.py
```
class WeatherApp:
```
This class is the main class of the application. It has all the methods to create the GUI and to make the request for the weather.

```
def __init__():
```
This method creates the main window of the application,

```
def open_meteo_icon():
```
Defines the icon image path.

```
def input_vals():
```

This method gets the user input values (_location_, _start date_ and _end date_) from the App entries and sends a request through the weather API.

```
def current_weather():
```

This method is called when the button _Current Weather_ is clicked. It then calls the _iterate_dic()_ which then adds the information regarding the current weather data to the App.

```
def forecast():
```

This methos is called when the button _Forecast_ is clicked. It then calls the _iterate_dic()_ which then adds the information regarding the forecast data to the App.

```
def iterate_dic():
```

This method parses the data information from the the API and creates a label with the extracted information.

```
def start():
```
This method calls the mainloop() for the app to run.


### utils.py

```
class TKUtils:

```


This class is used to create tkinter widgets. It has methods to create labels, entry fields and buttons. 
It is used to reduce the code duplication.

```
def create_label(
    master: tk.Tk, text: str, width: int = 10, height: int = 1
) -> tk.Label:
```

This function creates a label.

```
def create_entry(
    master: tk.Tk, width: int = 10, height: int = 1
) -> tk.Entry:
```

This function creates an entry field.

```
def create_button(
    master: tk.Tk,
    text: str,
    width: int = 10,
    height: int = 1,
    command: Callable = None,
) -> tk.Button:
```

This function creates a button.

## weather_utils.py

this file contain utils for the conversion of data from the API
```
from datetime import datetime
```
import for handling datetime
```
class WeatherUtils:
```
create the class
```
    @staticmethod
    def parse_location(data):
```
utils for parsing the location received and outputing a dict of the coordinate and the location name, the country is given to allow to check if we got the correct location (london ca vs london uk)
```
        try:
            coordinate = (data.get("latt"), data.get("longt"))
            location = (
                f'{data["standard"]["city"]},'
                f' {data["standard"]["countryname"]}'
            )
        except KeyError as e:
            return data
        return {"coordinate": coordinate, "location": location}
```
the coordinate are returned in a tuple and the location as a string
in case of error return back the data
```
    @staticmethod
    def json_convert(res_both):
```
convert the json, already in dict form from request,  received to a list of data

```
```
    @staticmethod
    def distribute(iter, key, target_list):
```
transform a dict of the form {a:[1,2], b:[3,4]} to a list of dict of the form [{a:1,b:3},{a:2,b:4}]
used because the api give the datas in the first format and we want to split it into separated data
```
        try:

                target_list[x][key] = iter[x]
        except IndexError:
            pass
```
```
    @staticmethod
    def convert_wind_direction(angle):
```
convert the wind direction from an angle in Â° to a cardinal direction
```
        inc = 360 / 16
        if angle <= 1 * inc or angle > 15 * inc:
            return "North"
        elif angle <= 3 * inc:

```
could also be done using a loop and a list of the direction
```
    @staticmethod
    def convert_wmo(code):
```
convert the WMO code to a human readable string, use a switch do to so (or rather match in the case of python)
```
